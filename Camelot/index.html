				<i><h3 id="History of Rum">History of Rum<h3></i>
				<p>The origins of rum can be found in antiquity with early fermented drinks based on sugarcane juice found in China and India.  
				Marco Polo in his travels in the mid 14th century encountered a “very good wine made from sugar” in what is now Iran.  
				The first modern rum, distilled from sugarcane byproducts, is found in the Caribbean during the 17th century when slaves, most 
				likely in the island of Barbados, found that molasses could be fermented into an alcoholic beverage and which could then be distilled 
				in order to remove its impurities.
                Soon after its appearance in the Caribbean, rum made its way into the American colonies.  Rum became hugely popular in the colonies, 
				resulting in the founding of the first rum distillery in the American continent in what is currently Staten Island.  A distillery in 
				Boston followed soon thereafter, which became famous for producing some of the best rum in the world at the time.  Due to the extremely 
				high demand for molasses with which to create rum in New England, huge numbers of African slaves were taken to the Caribbean islands in 
				order to work the sugar plantations.  Slaves would be taken to the islands in the Caribbean from Africa, with molasses going to the American 
				colonies and sugar going to Europe in a triangular trading setup that continued for many years.  Rum continued to be popular throughout 
				the American Revolution with George Washington even insisting on a gallon of rum at his Presidential inauguration in 1789.  The development 
				of American whiskey led to the decline in use of rum in the United States.
                Rum’s value as a trading commodity led to its becoming a favorite of privateers and pirates who would drink it while out at sea and also would 
				steal it from trading ships throughout the Caribbean.  In 1655, after taking control of Jamaica, England decided to start giving out a ration of 
				rum to its sailors, substituting their previous ration of French brandy.  This ration of rum, which was watered down before being distributed, 
				became known as grog and was a favorite of British sailors.  The daily ration of rum to British sailors continued to be in practice until 1970.
                While rum and its production were extremely important to the Caribbean islands and the American colonies, they were not the only ones producing rum.  
				In colonial Australia, rum became prized both as a drink and because of a lack of currency, as a form of payment.  Because of this practice, people 
				in Australia became associated with drunkenness in the eyes of their British colonizers.  In an effort to remedy their dependence on rum, the new 
				governor of New South Wales attempted to ban the use of rum as currency in 1806.  For this, William Bligh, the governor, was placed under arrest 
				in his house, allowing the mutineers to maintain control of the colony for the next four years.</p>
